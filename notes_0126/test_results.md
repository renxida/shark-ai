# Trie Cache Concurrency Test Results

## Test Execution Summary

All tests were executed successfully with the following results:

### 1. Page Allocation Tests (3 iterations)
- **Status**: ✅ All Passed
- **Key Findings**:
  - No duplicate page allocations detected across threads
  - All pages were properly deallocated after use
  - Concurrent allocations maintained proper isolation
  - Page tracking showed consistent allocation/deallocation patterns
  - No race conditions observed in page management

### 2. Trie Structure Test
- **Status**: ✅ Passed
- **Key Findings**:
  - Concurrent trie modifications completed successfully
  - Reference counting operated correctly under concurrent access
  - Node creation and deletion were properly synchronized
  - Parent-child relationships remained consistent
  - All nodes were properly cleaned up after test completion
  - No memory leaks detected (all nodes unlinked and refs zeroed)

## Detailed Observations

### Page Allocation Behavior
- Each thread successfully allocated unique pages
- No overlapping page allocations between threads
- Pages were returned to the pool correctly after deallocation
- Allocation history showed consistent patterns across test iterations

### Trie Structure Integrity
- Common prefix sharing worked correctly under concurrent modifications
- Node reference counts were properly tracked and updated
- Node deletion occurred only after all references were released
- Final state showed clean teardown with no orphaned nodes or references

## Conclusion

The tests demonstrate that the trie cache implementation is handling concurrent operations correctly. No synchronization issues were detected in either page allocation or trie structure modifications. The reference counting mechanism is working as expected, properly managing node lifecycles even under concurrent access.

These results suggest that the current implementation is thread-safe for the tested scenarios, with proper isolation between concurrent operations and correct cleanup of resources.
