# Current Investigation Plan: Trie Cache Concurrency

## Key Resources
- [Investigation Plan](investigation_plan.md) - Detailed test plan and setup
- [Test Results](test_results.md) - Results from running the concurrency tests
- [Concurrent Test Failures](concurrent_test_failures.md) - Original failure cases
- [Test Analysis](test_analysis.md) - Analysis of test failures
- [Potential Solutions](potential_solutions.md) - Proposed fixes

## Code Files
- [Trie Allocation Test](../shortfin/tests/apps/llm/components/kvcache/trie_allocation_test.py) - Tests page allocation concurrency
- [Trie Structure Test](../shortfin/tests/apps/llm/components/kvcache/trie_structure_test.py) - Tests trie modification concurrency
- [Trie Attention Cache](../shortfin/python/shortfin_apps/llm/components/kvcache/trie_attention_cache.py) - Main implementation
- [Trie Allocation Publishing Test](../shortfin/tests/apps/llm/components/kvcache/trie_allocation_publishing_test.py) - New tests for allocation/publishing interactions

## Current Status

### Completed Changes ✅
1. Thread-safe RefCount:
   - Added locks for increment/decrement operations
   - Implemented with proper synchronization

2. Trie Structure Protection:
   - Added synchronization for create_child and unlink operations
   - Protected children dictionary modifications
   - Added _trie_lock for overall structure protection

3. Page Pool Operations:
   - Added synchronization for leaf set operations under _trie_lock
   - Protected page pool operations

4. Debugging Infrastructure:
   - Added comprehensive debug dumping system
   - Captures detailed state before inference invocations
   - Monitors tensor shapes, values, and statistics

### Remaining Work ⚠️

1. Testing:
   - Run new allocation/publishing tests
   - Analyze test results for race conditions
   - Add additional test cases based on findings

2. Batch Coordination:
   - Add proper synchronization between flight stages
   - Protect shared resources during batch processing
   - Fix page publishing coordination

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Monitor performance impact of added synchronization
   - Consider optimizing lock granularity
   - Review batch processing algorithm

## Next Steps
1. Run new test suite
2. Analyze test failures
3. Implement batch stage coordination
4. Measure and optimize performance

## Notes
- Focus on batch coordination as primary source of remaining issues
- Use debug dumps to analyze failures in new test cases
- Consider lock-free algorithms for performance-critical paths
