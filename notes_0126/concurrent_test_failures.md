# Trie Attention Cache Concurrent Generation Issues

## Test Failures
- Test: `test_concurrent_generation[4-open_llama_3b-server1]`
- Test: `test_concurrent_generation[8-open_llama_3b-server1]`

## Key Observations
1. Failures occur only with trie-based sampler (server1)
2. Failures happen with both 4 and 8 concurrent requests
3. Issue appears to be specific to trie-based cache allocation system
4. Tests are currently marked as xfailed

## Potential Problem Areas
1. Cache allocation/deallocation during concurrent requests
2. Resource management in trie structure
3. Race conditions in trie operations
4. Memory management during concurrent access
5. Edge cases in trie node allocation/deallocation

## Investigation Points
1. How does the trie structure handle multiple concurrent requests?
2. Are there potential deadlocks in cache allocation?
3. Is there proper synchronization for concurrent trie operations?
4. Could memory fragmentation be occurring with concurrent allocations?
5. Are there any resource leaks during concurrent operations?
